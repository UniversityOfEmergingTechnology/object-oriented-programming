# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Flutter

## Basics of OOP

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of objects, which are instances of classes. OOP aims to organize code into reusable, self-contained modules called classes, allowing for better code organization, encapsulation, and abstraction.

## Classes

In Flutter, classes are blueprints for creating objects. They define the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) of objects. Classes encapsulate data and behavior within a single unit, promoting code reusability and modularity.

## Constructors

Constructors in Flutter are special methods used for initializing objects of a class. They are invoked when an object is created using the `new` keyword or by calling the class name directly. Constructors can be parameterized or default (no parameters).

## Getters and Setters

Getters and setters in Flutter are special methods used to access and modify the properties of an object, respectively. They provide controlled access to class members, allowing for validation and encapsulation. Getters retrieve the value of a property, while setters set the value of a property.

- Getters: Getters are methods used to retrieve the value of a property. They are defined using the `get` keyword followed by the property name.
- Setters: Setters are methods used to set the value of a property. They are defined using the `set` keyword followed by the property name.

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in OOP that refers to bundling the data (properties) and methods (behaviors) that operate on the data into a single unit (class). Encapsulation promotes data hiding and abstraction, allowing for better control and security of the data.

## Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism in OOP that allows a class (subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (superclass). Subclasses can extend the functionality of the superclass and override its methods to provide specialized behavior.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism is a concept in OOP that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables flexibility and extensibility in the code by allowing methods to be invoked dynamically based on the type of object.

## Abstraction

Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object. It allows developers to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it, promoting code simplicity and maintainability.

This README provides an overview of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Flutter, covering classes, constructors, getters and setters, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
